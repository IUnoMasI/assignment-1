                <h2> The life of a Space Marine</h2>  
 
                <p> The life of a space marine is that of glory and honor, however they pay a very big price
                </p>
                
                <img src="https://artwork.40k.gallery/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/40K-20190904074215.jpg" alt="A depiction of the blood angels fighting off the spawns of chaos">
                
                  <p>
                    Selected a young age, those chosen to ATTEMPT the transition into a space marine are exceptional individuals.
                    That being said, they still stand no chance against the vast amount of enemies they are to face.
                    After being selected, the candidate goes through a very painful transformation process where their bodies are modified and become super human.
                    Many do not survive this process.
                  </p>  
            
                  <p>
                    After a candidate is made into a space marine, they now must under go vigorous strength and psychological training.
                    Due to the amount of mental torment and corruption a human will face in the galactic battle that is the 40k universe, mental fortitude is an absolute must, less they get corrupted by the powers of chaos. 
                  </p>
                  <h3>A Life of Service</h3>

                  <p>Space marines live and die by the Emperor. The only time they retire, is when they die.
                    Space marines will spend their entire lives in service of the Imperium of Man fighting the good fight.
                  </p>
                <p>
                    Space marines are humanity's shield and sword blessed by The Emperor. Thanks to the unspeakable horrors that they face on a daily basis, humanity is allowed to simply exist, as this is the only luxury we can afford.
                    "Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods."
